# Accessing GNSS Data in Python 
This tutorial demonstrates how to access and retrieve GNSS time series from GeoNet Network in the programming language Python. Please note these examples use Python 3, so the syntax may differ slightly to Python 2.7. We recommend you use Python 3 as it has some important bug fixes.
