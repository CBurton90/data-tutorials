The purpose of this repository is to provide a home for several Data tutorials written to improve the accessibility of the different GeoNet's data sets. This repository provides an easy way to access the tutorials, versioning, and allows the users to suggest changes or improvements.

The files in this folders are Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate simple ways to retrieve data from different services such as: FDSN, FITS, etc. in Python and R programming languages. 

## Summary of Tutorials

| Data type  | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Seismic Data](Seismic_Data) | Tutorials demostrating how to get earthquake/seismic data throught the different FDSN web services (Dataselect, Station and Event). The Tutorials are presented in Jupyter notebooks written in Pyrhon and R Programming languages.|
| [GNSS Data](GNSS_Data) | Tutorials that demonstrate how to retrieve and perform basic tasks with GNSS Data, mostly with the use of FITS API. The Tutorials are presented in Jupyter notebooks written in Python and R Programming languages.|
